This week's question:
Given the non-negative integer n , output the value of its hyperfactorial. Don't worry about outputs exceeding your language's integer limit. 

Example:

```js
> hyperfactorial(0)
> 1

> hyperfactorial(2)
> 4
> 
> hyperfactorial(3)
> 108

> hyperfactorial(7)
> 3319766398771200000
```
