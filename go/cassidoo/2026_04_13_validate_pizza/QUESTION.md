This week's question:
You're building a pizza ordering system that enforces strict ingredient layering rules. Given an array of pizza layers (bottom to top) and a set of rules where each rule states that ingredient A must appear somewhere below ingredient B, write a function that determines whether the pizza is valid. If any rule is violated, return the pair [A, B] that was violated first (in the order the rules are given). If the pizza is valid, return true. 

Example:

```js
const layers = ["dough", "sauce", "cheese", "pepperoni", "basil"];
const rules = [
  ["sauce", "cheese"],
  ["cheese", "pepperoni"],
  ["dough", "basil"],
];
const rules2 = [
  ["cheese", "pepperoni"],
  ["cheese", "sauce"], // "it's under the sauce"
];

validatePizza(layers, rules);
> true

validatePizza(layers, rules2);
> ['cheese', 'sauce']
```
