Given a positive integer n, write a function that returns an array containing all integers from 1 to n, where each integer i appears exactly i times in the result. For example, 3 should appear 3 times, 5 should appear 5 times, and so on. The order of the integers in the output array does not matter.

Example:

```js
> repeatedIntegers(4)
> [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]
```
