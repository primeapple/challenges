This week's question:
You are given a file system represented as an object where keys are absolute paths and values are either null (real file/directory) or a string (a symlink pointing to another path). Write a function that resolves a given path to its real destination, following symlinks along the way. If a symlink chain forms a cycle, return null. 

Example:

```js
const fs = {
  "/a": "/b",
  "/b": "/c",
  "/c": null,
  "/loop1": "/loop2",
  "/loop2": "/loop1",
  "/real": null,
  "/alias": "/real",
};

resolvePath(fs, "/a");      // "/c"
resolvePath(fs, "/alias");  // "/real"
resolvePath(fs, "/loop1");  // null
resolvePath(fs, "/real");   // "/real"
```
