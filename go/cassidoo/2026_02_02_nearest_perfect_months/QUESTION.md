This week's question:
February 2026 is a [perfect month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_month)! Write a function that returns the closest previous and next perfect month around the given Gregorian year. 

Example:

```js
nearestPerfectMonths(2025)
> { prev: "2021-02", next: "2026-02" }

nearestPerfectMonths(2026)
> { prev: "2026-02", next: "2027-02" }
```
