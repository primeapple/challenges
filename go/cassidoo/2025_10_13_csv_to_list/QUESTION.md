This week's question:
Given a CSV string where each row contains a name, age, and city (and values may be quoted, have embedded commas or escaped quotes), write a function that parses the CSV and outputs a formatted list of strings in the form: "Name, age Age, from City". Handle quoted fields containing commas and escaped quotes. 

Example:

```js
const csv = 'name,age,city\n"Ryu, Mi-yeong",30,"Seoul"\nZoey,24,"Burbank"'

csvToList(csv)
> `
- Ryu, Mi-yeong, age 30, from Seoul
- Zoey, age 24, from Burbank
`
```
