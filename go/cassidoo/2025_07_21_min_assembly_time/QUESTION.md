You're assembling a custom mechanical keyboard.
Each required part has a delivery time in days and an assembly time in hours.
You can only assemble a part after it arrives and you can only work on one part at a time.
Given an array of parts where each part is `{ name, arrivalDate, assemblyHours }`, return the minimal total hours needed to finish assembling all parts, starting from hour 0.
